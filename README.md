# Bulldog Book

**Bookdog Book** is a Chrome extension that adds to Facebook profiles of
current Yale undergrads information about their residential colleges, class
year and dorm numbers. It's the same data that all Yale undergraduates have
access to through the Yale Facebook. Naturally, you must be a Yale student
in order to use this extension.

According to the Yale Facebook website, this data is "intended for official
University use and for individual communication of a business or incidental
personal nature between individuals who are included in the facebook/directory".
